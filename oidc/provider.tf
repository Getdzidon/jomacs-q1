# AWS Provider Configuration
# Note: Ensure the S3 bucket is created manually (or with a different terraform configuration) before running this configuration.

# Note: the backend values here are hardcodded because the backend "(terraform { backend "s3" { ... } })" is initialized before any variables or data sources are evaluated. Terraform needs to know where to find your state file before it can evaluate anything else.
