# For a static website or a PHP-based application, you might want to use a web server like Nginx or Apache instead of Node.js. 
# However, for a Node.js application, especially if it's a dynamic app or API, you donâ€™t need Nginx or Apache unless you're using 
# them for reverse proxying (which is common but not necessary in every case).


#Already used the following app-deploy.yml file to deploy the app on AWS EC2 instance
# Or use nginx as reverse proxy server for nodejs app
# sudo apt-get install -y update
# sudo apt-get install -y upgrade
# sudo apt-get install -y nginx
