# For a static website or a PHP-based application, you might want to use a web server like Nginx or Apache instead of Node.js. 
# However, for a Node.js application, especially if it's a dynamic app or API, you donâ€™t need Nginx or Apache unless you're using 
# them for reverse proxying (which is common but not necessary in every case).
